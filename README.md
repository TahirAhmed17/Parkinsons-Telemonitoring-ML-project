# Parkinson’s Disease Progression Prediction Using Machine Learning | Guide - Dr.Ram Prasad Krishnamoorthy 
– Designed a full ML pipeline: preprocessing, tuning (GridSearchCV), and training on Parkinson’s dataset (R² = 0.9992).

– Built and evaluated models (SVR, RF, GB) with 5-fold CV and feature scaling.

– Used PCA/t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and visual pattern analysis.
